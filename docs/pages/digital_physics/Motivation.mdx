# Motivation

**Digital physics are rules written in smart contracts based on the tenets of physics for how objects in space interact.**

### Smart Contracts

Physics are the only set of rules in our world that are an ever-present part of reality. Unlike human-constructed rules and systems, physics cannot be turned off, changed, opted out of, or argued against.

Using smart contracts, human-defined rules are endowed with the properties of physics. They become an ever-present part of reality, ownerless, and cannot be turned off or changed.

The internet is the closest analogy to an existing virtual system that is an ownerless, ever-present part of reality which cannot be turned off. However, its scope is limited to message-passing whereas smart contracts are programmable and stateful.

### Tenets of Physics

Existing virtual worlds are defined with high-level, specific rules for each player interaction with the environment. For example, a door can only be opened if the developer had explicitly programmed a specific interaction, like a player pressing a key "E" when near the door.

Worlds with shallow physics and high-level game rules will result in players exhausting all the directly prescribed interactions and finding the world unrewarding over time, clashing with the intended long-term ever-presence of smart contracts.

  <p>*Qualitative difference between a physics in which a car moves because the model’s location in space is directly updated by the game engine, versus one in which it moves because the wheels impart a force on the road, versus one in which chemical reactions propagate force down a cam shaft to a transmission which in turn imparts force onto the axle, then the wheel, then the material of the road surface, and the car is propelled forward via second law reaction. We can see the gain in expressiveness as the level of the “physics” is moved down.*</p>

Since the primary purpose of creating ownerless, ever-present virtual systems like the internet is to maximize emergence over an indefinitely long period of time, it's crucial that we transition from traditional game design towards systems with strong tenets of physics. These systems don't need to mimic physics exactly, but need its properties like space, locality, causality, and conservation cycles.

This will unlock worlds where storylines can continue to emerge and creations can continue to be engineered over an indefinitely long period of time. Early signs of this can be seen in [our case studies](/digital_physics/Everlon_Case_Studies).

  <br/>
  <p>Transitioning from [traditional game design](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) to systems with strong tenets of physics means resources are objects occupying space and requiring physical movement. High-level game inventories that allow arbitrary storage and access without occupying physical space are not possible. This increases emergence, as players must coordinate to build and manage storage, transport, and defense systems to protect and allocate resources.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Transitioning from [traditional game design](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) to systems with strong tenets of physics also changes the concept of private property. In these systems, the high-level claim of land as private property can't actually prevent that space from being occupied or manipulated by other objects. This leads to the emergence of protective measures, such as players self-organizing into “militaries,” to safeguard social constructs like land ownership.</p>

**Rules with the tenets of physics enforced using smart contracts result in highly emergent virtual worlds which can become an ever-present part of reality.**
