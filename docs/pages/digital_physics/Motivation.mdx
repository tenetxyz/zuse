# Motivation

### Digital physics are rules written in smart contracts based on the tenets of physics for how objects in space interact.

#### Smart Contracts

Physics is the only set of rules in our world that is an ever-present part of reality. Unlike human-constructed rules and systems, physics cannot be turned off, changed, opted out of, or argued against.

Using smart contracts, human-defined rules are endowed with the properties of physics. They become an ever-present part of reality, ownerless, and cannot be turned off or changed.

The internet is the closest analogy to an existing virtual system that is an ownerless, ever-present part of reality which cannot be turned off. However, its scope is limited to message-passing while smart contracts are programmable and stateful.

#### Tenets of Physics

Existing virtual worlds are defined with high-level, specific rules for each player interaction with the environment. For example, a door can only be opened if the developer had explicitly programmed a specific interaction, like a player pressing a key "E" when near the door. This reduces the expressivity of the world and limits broadly general emergent behavior.

> Qualitative difference between a physics in which a car moves because the model’s location in space is directly updated by the game engine, versus one in which it moves because the wheels impart a force on the road, versus one in which chemical reactions propagate force down a cam shaft to a transmission which in turn imparts force onto the axle, then the wheel, then the material of the road surface, and the car is propelled forward via second law reaction. We can see the gain in expressiveness as the level of the “physics” is moved down.

**Rules with the tenets of physics enforced using smart contracts result in highly emergent virtual worlds which can become an ever-present part of reality.**
