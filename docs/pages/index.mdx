# Zuse 

[MUD](https://mud.dev/) is a framework for building ambitious apps on the EVM, and ZUSE is a framework for building worlds with strong digital physics on MUD.

[Spatial Store](/spatial_store) enforces a data model where positions in a 3D space are occupied by objects, some of which are externally controlled by EOAs and initiate state change.  Digital physics is the set of rules for how those objects in space interact. To define it, the world creator can use libraries for [Space Initialization](/space_initialization/introduction) and [Space Transition Function](/space_transition_function/introduction).

Then, the world is deployed and players can permissionlessly shape everything that emerges. They can engineer new creations which abide by the rules, and write [Narrative Contracts](narrative) which read the world to create objectives and storylines.
