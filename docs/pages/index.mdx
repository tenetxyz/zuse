## Digital Physics: Design Paradigm For Onchain Worlds
 
Traditionally, virtual worlds have been built on computers, and computers are controlled by their owners. These owners follow a top-down game design paradigm where they shape every aspect of their virtual world as a product meant to be consumed, not co-created. They define everything from the world's physics to player objectives and storylines to its aesthetics. Virtual worlds built onchain have no owners, they're meant to be permissionlessly shaped by everyone. This requires a new design paradigm where the initial rules of a virtual world are crafted by its creators, but afterwards everything about the world is permissionlessly shaped by its players.

This new design paradigm is called digital physics. The world creator just deploys resources and crafts physics for how they interact. Nothing else is defined or enforced by the world. This gives the opportunity to the players to permissionlessly shape everything else: all the objectives and storylines that emerge, and all the creations that get engineered.

## Zuse: Framework For Digital Physics

[MUD](https://mud.dev/) is a framework for building ambitious apps on the EVM, and ZUSE is a framework for building worlds with strong digital physics on MUD.

[Spatial Store](/spatial_store) enforces a data model where positions in a 3D space are occupied by objects, some of which are externally controlled by EOAs and initiate state change.  Digital physics is the set of rules for how those objects in space interact. To define it, the world creator can use libraries for [Space Initialization](/space_initialization/introduction) and [Space Transition Function](/space_transition_function/introduction).

Then, the world is deployed and players can permissionlessly shape everything that emerges. They can add new objects which abide by the rules, and write [Narrative Contracts](narrative) which read the world to create objectives and storylines.
